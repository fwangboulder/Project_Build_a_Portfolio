# Project_Build_a_Portfolio

**Project 2 for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**

Developed a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links
to each of the portfolio projects I will complete throughout the course of my
Nanodegree program.

**Project Overview**

This website changes based on the characteristics of the device. I have used
the powerful mobile-first flexbox grid system included in Bootstrap and applied
CSS using media queries.

**How to test this website**

Step 1: git clone this repository.
        $ git clone https://github.com/fwangboulder/Project_Build_a_Portfolio.git

Step 2: open index.html file in your browser.

step 3: change the size of your browser and see the changes of the pattern.

step 4: click the figures and links to see other projects (have not completed yet).
